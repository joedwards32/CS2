# What is Counter-Strike 2?
For over two decades, Counter-Strike has offered an elite competitive experience, one shaped by millions of players from across the globe. And now the next chapter in the CS story is about to begin. This is Counter-Strike 2. 
This Docker image contains the dedicated server of the game.

# How to use this image
## Hosting a simple game server

Running on the *host* interface (recommended):<br/>
```console
$ docker run -d --net=host --name=cs2 -e STEAMUSER={YOUR_STEAM_USER} -e STEAMPASS={YOUR_STEAM_PASSWD} joedwards32/cs2
```

Running using a bind mount for data persistence on container recreation:
```console
$ mkdir -p $(pwd)/cs2-data
$ chmod 777 $(pwd)/cs2-data # Makes sure the directory is writeable by the unprivileged container user
$ docker run -d --net=host -v $(pwd)/cs2-data:/home/steam/cs2-dedicated/ --name=cs2-dedicated -e STEAMUSER={YOUR_STEAM_USER} -e STEAMPASS={YOUR_STEAM_PASSWD} joedwards32/cs2
```

`STEAMUSER` and `STEAMPASS` **are required as unlike CS:GO, CS2 can not be downloaded anonymously (at time of writing).**

`STEAMGUARD` **must be used to provide your more recent Steam Guard key if Steam Guard is enabled on your account.**

**The container will automatically update the game on startup, so if there is a game update just restart the container.**
